1. The data structure I implemented is a hash table and the algorithm is heapsort. Words and word counts are held in a hash table. For the hash function, I use single hashing and collisions are handled by open addressing.
2. I had some problems with the tests for Small file and WarPeace file. The tests didn't pass on my personal computer even though they passed on my another computer and on teacher's computer. With the teacher, I tried to solve this problem in many different ways, but we couldn't find the solution. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the correctness of my implementation.
3. The sorting algorithm I use is heapsort. It is an efficient algorithm. The time complexity of heapsort is O(n log n), so I think that the time complexity of my implementation is the same. I think my code is efficient because it takes about 3 to 4 seconds to run the tests for Bulk.txt and the number of collisions is 5596.
4. I faced many difficult things when doing this course project. Hashing and heapsort were difficult of course, but since I had used them in previous exercises, they weren't that hard to use anymore. The most difficult things were probably in the beginning. For example, before I found out that I need to use an inner class for WordCount-objects. 
5. I learned so many things while doing the course project that it's impossible to list them all. All in all, I think I'm better at doing larger coding projects that I was before this project.
